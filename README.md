Project Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (purchase a product or service) based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains various attributes related to the customer's personal details and interaction history with the bank.
